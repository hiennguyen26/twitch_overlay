============================================
  DROP YOUR SPRITES HERE
============================================

Replace these placeholder files with your own PNGs (transparent background).
Keep the EXACT same filenames.

Required sprites:
  idle_tongue_in.png   - Idle frame 1 (tongue in, alternates with tongue_out)
  idle_tongue_out.png  - Idle frame 2 (tongue out, alternates with tongue_in)
  talk_1.png           - Talk frame 1 (alternates with talk_2)
  talk_2.png           - Talk frame 2 (alternates with talk_1)
  scream.png           - When you're yelling (loud mic input)
  wasd_1.png           - WASD frame 1 (alternates with wasd_2)
  wasd_2.png           - WASD frame 2 (alternates with wasd_1)
  mouse_click.png      - When clicking mouse (left or side button)

Tips:
  - Use consistent canvas size (e.g., 512x512)
  - Transparent PNG backgrounds
  - Animated sprites alternate automatically while the trigger is active
  - Idle panting is slow (600ms per frame), talk is faster (200ms), WASD medium (250ms)
